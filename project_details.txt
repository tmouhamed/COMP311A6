To simulate code, this file is going to list the things we are doing, in perceived order:

1. Initial commit of README.md to the main branch.
2. Addition of this project_details.txt file, filled with text representative of a code being pushed to the repository.
3. Branch feature/add_new_feature was created from main.
4. feature/add_new_feature introduced new changes to the file project_details.txt. This simulates adding a new feature to the existing code in the main branch.
5. Adding fix for issue1 introduced by this branch as indicated in PR #1.
